## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🔹 Integrated SRE Platform  
📌 Repository: `sre-integrated-project`

A **hands-on, end-to-end SRE implementation** that demonstrates how modern reliability engineering is applied in real systems.

**What this project showcases:**
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**
- Kubernetes-based service deployment with health checks
- **Observability stack** (metrics, dashboards, alerts)
- Incident-readiness and operational workflows
- **Progressive delivery** using Argo Rollouts (canary-based deployments)

This project is structured to reflect **how SRE is practiced in production environments**, from foundational setup to advanced deployment safety.
